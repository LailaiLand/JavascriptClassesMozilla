      When authoring custom element constructors, authors are bound by the
      following conformance requirements:
      <ul>
        <li>
          A parameter-less call to super() must be the first statement in the
          constructor body, to establish the correct prototype chain and this
          value before any further code is run.
        </li>
        <li>
          A return statement must not appear anywhere inside the constructor
          body, unless it is a simple early-return (return or return this).
        </li>
        <li>
          The constructor must not use the document.write() or document.open()
          methods.
        </li>
        <li>
          The element's attributes and children must not be inspected, as in the
          non-upgrade case none will be present, and relying on upgrades makes
          the element less usable.
        </li>
        <li>
          The element must not gain any attributes or children, as this violates
          the expectations of consumers who use the createElement or
          createElementNS methods.
        </li>
        <li>
          In general, work should be deferred to connectedCallback as much as
          possibleâ€”especially work involving fetching resources or rendering.
          However, note that connectedCallback can be called more than once, so
          any initialization work that is truly one-time will need a guard to
          prevent it from running twice.
        </li>
        <li>
          In general, the constructor should be used to set up initial state and
          default values, and to set up event listeners and possibly a shadow
          root.
        </li>
      </ul>
      The define() method takes the following arguments:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h3>name</h3>
          The name of the element. This must start with a lowercase letter,
          contain a hyphen, and satisfy certain other rules listed in the
          specification's definition of a valid name.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>constructor</h3>
          The custom element's constructor function.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>options</h3>
          Only included for customized built-in elements, this is an object
          containing a single property extends, which is a string naming the
          built-in element to extend.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
